1) ISSY calculation and insertion (Ignored for current moment)
In NM ISSY is inserted to TS before packetizing into BB frames.
In NM ISSY is inserted as additional bytes in the end of each transport packet:
[CRC-8 of previous packet 1 byte] + [header (no sync-byte) 3 bytes] + [payload 184 bytes] + [ISSY 2 or 3 bytes]
To insert ISSY in TS, we should have some reserve of time

2) CRC-8 is calculated on negedge to be on time. May be dangerous

3) input_ts_prepare module needs to be re-architected, looks unoptimal

4) Still haven't decided, to reset modules: "ts_to_t2mi_packets" and "t2mi_over_ts" on sync loss or not

5) input FIFO may fullfill (has capacity 64 words) on bitrates ~50 Mbps
