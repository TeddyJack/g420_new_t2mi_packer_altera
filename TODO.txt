1) ISSY calculation and insertion (Ignored for current moment)
In NM ISSY is inserted to TS before packetizing into BB frames.
In NM ISSY is inserted as additional bytes in the end of each transport packet:
[CRC-8 of previous packet 1 byte] + [header (no sync-byte) 3 bytes] + [payload 184 bytes] + [ISSY 2 or 3 bytes]
To insert ISSY in TS, we should have some reserve of time

2) CRC-8 is calculated on negedge to be on time. May be dangerous

3) InsertTables module is written too complicated. Need to optimize

4) Used 2 FIFOs: input and output. The output is not necessary, it is made to simplify logic. Need to make TS2T2MIpackets module work only when T2MIoverTS has state: insert_payload
